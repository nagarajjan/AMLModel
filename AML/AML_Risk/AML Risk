Creating specific risk categories and identifying red flags is a fundamental part of a risk-based 
compliance program for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Key risk areas include Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs),
high-risk countries, cash-intensive businesses, and customers with complex ownership structures,
each presenting distinct customer and transaction data red flags. To understand the specific data points that
trigger heightened scrutiny within these categories, review the detailed information provided

To add AML risk category data and logic to your system, you can use Python to define data structures and implement a function for risk scoring. This code snippet shows how to represent high-risk customer categories and their associated red flags. It can be integrated into your existing AML process, perhaps within the data preprocessing or feature engineering steps, 
to enrich your dataset before training or to enhance the RAG agent's queries.

# AML risk category code
This Python script defines a RISK_CATEGORIES dictionary containing the data and red flags for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), 
high-risk countries, cash-intensive businesses, and customers with complex ownership structures. It also includes a sample 
function, assess_customer_risk, that shows how this information can be used to generate a risk score and relevant
red flags for a given customer.

How to integrate this into your existing AML system
Enrich RAG context: The RISK_CATEGORIES dictionary can be used to generate a more detailed prompt for your RAG agent. 
When a transaction is flagged, you can provide the LLM with the risk category
descriptions and red flags relevant to that specific customer.
Feature Engineering: The assess_customer_risk function can be used to create new features for your 
Isolation Forest model. For example, the risk_score could be included as a numerical feature, or binary 
flags for each risk category could be added.
Dashboard Enhancement: In your Streamlit dashboard, you can display the triggered_flags and risk_score to
give the compliance officer more context for an AML alert, thereby improving the agent's explanation.

To integrate the risk category logic from aml_risk_data.py into your AML pipeline, you'll need to modify both aml_process_python_code.py (for feature enrichment during training and saving relevant data) and aml_agent_app.py (to use this enriched data for a more informative dashboard and RAG prompt).
This involves three main updates:
Enrich the transaction data: A function is needed to join transaction data with customer data containing risk information.
Modify the training script: Update aml_process_python_code.py to use the enriched data for training and save the additional required artifacts.
Modify the dashboard script: Update aml_agent_app.py to use the enriched data, display risk category flags in the dashboard, and include this information in the RAG prompt for a more context-aware response.
Step 1: Create a sample customer_data.csv
Your AML model relies on transaction data, but the risk categories require customer-specific data. Create a new CSV file named customer_data.csv to hold this information.
customer_data.csv
csv
customer_id,country,industry,is_pep,complex_ownership_score
101,HighRiskCountryA,finance,TRUE,0.85
234,LowRiskCountry,retail,FALSE,0.15

Step 2: Update aml_process_python_code.py
This script is modified to perform the following:
Import the RISK_CATEGORIES data.
Create a function enrich_data_with_risk_flags to add customer risk features to the transaction data.
Update the train_or_retrain_model to save the customer_data and the column names for consistent preprocessing.
aml_process_python_code.py

Step 3: Update aml_agent_app.py
This script is modified to handle the new risk data:
Import RISK_CATEGORIES.
Load the customer_data.csv and aml_column_names.joblib file.
Update run_aml_engine to enrich the data before prediction.
Modify the dashboard to display the new risk flags and include them in the RAG prompt.
aml_agent_app.py

To generate the aml_risk_data.py file, you can use a Python script that writes the content directly to a new file. 
This ensures all the necessary data structures and logic are available for the other parts of your AML system.
create_aml_risk_data.py
This script, when executed, will create the aml_risk_data.py file in the same directory, populating it with the 
required code.

This process requires you to run several Python scripts in a specific order to set up the AML model and then start the dashboard. Follow these steps carefully to ensure all dependencies are met and the files are created correctly.
Prerequisites
Install Ollama: If you haven't already, download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com/.
Pull the LLM model: Open a terminal and run ollama pull llama3.
Start Ollama server: Run ollama serve in a terminal and leave it running.
Install Python libraries: Run pip install llama-index llama-index-llms-ollama llama-index-embeddings-huggingface pandas numpy joblib streamlit
Set up file structure: Create a directory for your project. Inside it, create another directory named docs and save your aml_procedures.txt file within it.
Step-by-step execution
Step 1: Create the risk data script
This script, aml_risk_data.py, defines the customer risk categories and assessment logic. It is imported by other scripts, so it must be created first.
Save the following code as aml_risk_data.py in your project directory.
aml_risk_data.py

Step 2: Run the AML training script
This script will generate the machine learning model (aml_model.joblib), the scaler (aml_scaler.joblib),
and the column names (aml_column_names.joblib) that the dashboard needs.
Save the provided aml_process_python_code.py code.
Ensure you have the sample customer_data.csv available.
Run the script from your terminal: python aml_process_python_code.py
Step 3: Run the Streamlit dashboard
This script launches the interactive dashboard where you can upload the new transactions and use the RAG agent for analysis.
Save the aml_agent_app.py code.
Make sure the Ollama server is still running in a separate terminal.
In your terminal, run the Streamlit application: streamlit run aml_agent_app.py
Step 4: Interact with the dashboard
Your web browser will open the Streamlit application.
Click the "Browse files" button and upload the new_aml_transactions.csv file.
The AML engine will process the file and display any detected anomalies.
Select a transaction ID from the dropdown menu to trigger the RAG agent and see its analysis, 
including references to your aml_procedures.txt document.

The create_aml_risk_data.py script is a utility script. Its sole purpose is to programmatically generate the aml_risk_data.py file, which contains the AML risk categories, data, and assessment logic. 
You should only need to run create_aml_risk_data.py once. After it has successfully created the aml_risk_data.py file, you can delete it if you wish. The other parts of your AML system will then import and use the newly created aml_risk_data.py file.
How to use create_aml_risk_data.py
Save the script: Save the code provided for create_aml_risk_data.py as a Python file in your project directory.
Run from the terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and execute the script:
sh
python create_aml_risk_data.py


Confirm the file is created: After running, you should see a new file named aml_risk_data.py in the same directory.
Proceed with other steps: With aml_risk_data.py now in place, you can proceed with running the other scripts 
in your AML pipeline, such as training the model and starting the Streamlit dashboard.
